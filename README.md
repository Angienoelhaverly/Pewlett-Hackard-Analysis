# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The goal behind the analysis of Pewlett Hackard data is to help the management team plan and develop a strategy to identify employees who are ready retire in the near future, thus preparing for a "silver tsunami". We will use PostgreSQL to create a database with new tables in order to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 
### Project Overview
The initial data for the project came from six CSV files. These files contained data on thousands of employees from Pewlett Hackard. Their column headers and relationships are diagrammed in the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) shown below. The ERD was created using Quick DBD. 
In this analysis we use three separate tools: 
* QuickDBD to create quick database design for better visualization,
* PostreSQL a database system to load, build and host companyâ€™s data, and
* pgAdmin a GUI, using SQL Language to explore, manipulate and extract the data.

The ERD maps the relationships between the files which will be used to create the database and join tables to view the data in the required schema. Primary keys and foreign keys are also determined in the ERD. After the schema is created, we run queries on the tables to isolate the requested employee information. Query results are then turned into tables and exported as CSV files.

## Results 
* A total of 90,398 employees are about to retire from the company. This represents 30% of the company's total 300,024 employees. 
    * This is a staggering number of employees who will be retiring soon and definitely confirms that HR needs to put into action immediate strategy to prepare for their replacement. 
    * This data can be found by viewing the "unique_titles" table in the database or in the exported csv "unique_titles.csv". 
* The majority of the staff ready to retire are Senior Engineers (33% of total retiring), and Senior Staff (32% of total retiring). 
    * This outcome will leave quite a gap in the technical department and high level skill. These positions are also ones that require a higher portion of training, development, and skill. The company indeed has a challenge ahead. 
    * This data can be found by viewing the "retiring_titles" table in the database or in the exported csv "retiring_titles.csv"
* The least amount of employees who need replacing include Assistant Engineers and Managers. 
    * Hopefully this smaller number for Assistant Engineers will provide the company with some wiggle room to quickly train up the Assistant Engineers to become promoted to Senior Engineers. 
* There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. In comparison to the total number of employees eligible to retire, this is not a very high percentage. Less than 2% in fact. 
    * However, this is still better than nothing, and at least still a plan to move forward in some level of replacement planning. 
    * This data can be found by viewing the "mentorship_eligibility" table in the database or in the exported csv "mentorship_eligibilitys.csv"

## Summary
High Level Overview
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?: 
    * According to the database, 90,398 roles will have to be filled in the next few years. 
    * The HR department should intially focus on Senior Enginner and Senior Staff roles as 29,414 and 28,254 positions will need to be filled. 
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
    * After running a query that checks to see how many retirement ready staff are available to mentor the next generation (query searches for higher level employees), it is clear that there are enough staff who are ready to retire that can handle the mentorship program. The query below shows how many retirement ready staff there are by title.
